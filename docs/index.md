# Welcome to the Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning book (work in progress)

This will be the homepage for the online book version of the Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning: Zero to Mastery course.

This course will teach you foundations of deep learning and PyTorch (a deep learning framework written in Python).

The course is video based. However, the videos are based on the contents of this online book.

For full code and resources see the [course GitHub](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning).

## Status

Videos are done for 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07.

Currently working on [chapter 08: paper replicating](https://www.learnpytorch.io/08_pytorch_paper_replicating/).

Chapters 08, 09 will come after.

See progress on the course [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/mrdbourke/projects/1/views/4).

**Expected release date:** Early-Mid 2022.

**Get updates:** Follow the [`pytorch-deep-learning`](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning#log) repo log or [sign up for emails](https://www.mrdbourke.com/newsletter/).
